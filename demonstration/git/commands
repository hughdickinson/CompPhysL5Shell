# Git demonstration material from Lecture 5

# Perform initial setup:
# ======================
# Set global configuration values for user.email and user.name
# or git will complain when we try to commit our changes

git config --global user.email "incognito@noplace.com"
git config --global user.name "Lord Lucan"

# Create a "bare" clone of the repository that hould have been created at:
# /home/computationalphysics/Documents/cPlusPlus/myProjects
#
# This will act as our "remote" repository. A "bare" repository is required
# in order to demonstrate the push functionality, but don't worry about it
#otherwise 

git clone --bare file:///home/computationalphysics/Documents/cPlusPlus/myProjects /home/computationalphysics/Documents/cPlusPlus/myProjectsBare

# Now create two clones of the "bare" repository 
git clone file:///home/computationalphysics/Documents/cPlusPlus/myProjectsBare firstClone

git clone file:///home/computationalphysics/Documents/cPlusPlus/myProjectsBare secondClone

ls -R

# Modify the state of the first clone:
# ====================================
# Navigate to the original repository location and create a new file
cd firstClone
echo "PING" > tableTennis

# Examine the contents of the file
cat tableTennis

# Stage and commit this new file.
git add tableTennis
git commit -m"Added tableTennis for git pull/push demo"

# Update the "remote" repository to reflect our modifications:
# ============================================================
# Use git push to update the "bare" repository to reflect
# our commited modifications.
git push

# Verify that the "remote" repository way updated:
# ================================================
# Navigate back to the second cloned directory
cd ../secondClone
ls

# Using git pull to update the local working directory
# to reflect the current state of the "remote" repository.
git pull
ls

# Add another line to the "tableTennis" file
echo "PONG" >> tableTennis

# Stage and commit this new file.
git add tableTennis
git commit -m"Updated tableTennis - watch out for that wicked spin\!"

# Use git push to update the "bare" repository to reflect
# our commited modifications.
git push


# then navigate back to the second cloned directory
cd ../firstClone
ls

# Examine the contents of "tableTennis"
cat tableTennis

# Nothing's changed! We still need to execute git pull to
# update the working directory's contents
git pull
cat tableTennis
